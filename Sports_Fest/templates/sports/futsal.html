        <h2>Handball Rule</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Players cannot deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms. Deliberate handball results in a foul.</li>
            <li>Accidental handball may not be penalized if the contact was unintentional and the player had no time to react.</li>
            <li>Deliberate handball in defense, especially within the penalty area, can lead to a penalty kick for the opposing team.</li>
            <li>Exceptions include situations where the ball deflects off another player or if the arms are in a natural position.</li>
