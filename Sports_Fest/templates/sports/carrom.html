        <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Players decide who goes first, often by a coin toss or by lagging the striker.</li>
                    <li>The first player strikes from within the baseline (the line at the edge of the board).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Striking:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players must flick the striker with one finger to hit the carrom men.</li>
                    <li>The striker must be placed within the baseline and flicked with precision.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pocketing:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A player continues their turn as long as they pocket their assigned carrom men.</li>
                    <li>If no carrom men are pocketed, the turn passes to the opponent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Queen Rules:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The queen can be pocketed at any time but must be covered by pocketing one of your carrom men in the following turn.</li>
                    <li>If the queen is not covered, it is returned to the center of the board.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

    <section id="scoring">
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carrom Men:</strong> Each carrom man is worth 1 point.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen:</strong> The queen is worth 3 points but must be covered by pocketing one of your carrom men in the next turn.</li>

    <section id="additional-rules">
        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Covering the Queen:</strong> If a player pockets the queen but fails to cover it in the next turn, the queen is returned to the center of the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> Fouls result in a penalty, often the return of a previously pocketed carrom man to the center of the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Rearranging Coins:</strong> If the pieces get disturbed or go out of position, they are returned to their original positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Each player is usually given a specific time (e.g., 10 seconds) to take their shot.</li>
        </ul>
