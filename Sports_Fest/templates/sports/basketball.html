        <p>This sport will be a mixed team sport. Each team needs to provide 2 female + 2 male players. You can keep as many substitutes as you want, and there will be rolling substitutions.</p>
        <li><b>Offense team:</b> The team which has the ball is called the offense team.</li>
        <li><b>Defense team:</b> The team that tries to stop the offense team from scoring the basket is called the defense team.</li>
        <li><b>3-point line:</b> The outermost curve on the basketball court is called the 3-point line.</li>
    </ul>
    </section id="definitions">
    <section id="definitions">
    <h2>Points System</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you score a basket outside the 3-point line, your team will be awarded 3 points (outside the green area and black curve - Figure 1).</li>
        <li>If you score from anywhere inside the 3-point line, you will be given 2 points (green area and red area combined - Figure 1).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The matches will be 10 minutes long and the game will be half court.</li>
        <li>There will be a 5-second foul for the offensive team and a 12-second foul for the defensive team. This means:
            <ul>
                <li>The team with the ball can't stay in the red area (Figure 1) for more than 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>The defensive team can't stay in the red area (Figure 1) for more than 12 seconds.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Since this is a half-court game, in the event of a rebound by the defense team, they must move out to the 3-point line (outside the green area - Figure 2) to make a "clearance" (Figure 2, red arrow) before attempting a basket (Figure 2, blue arrow).</li>
        <li>Each team can call a maximum of 3 timeouts during the game. Each timeout lasts 45 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Reaching Fouls:</b> Touching a player holding a ball is a foul, but touching the ball is allowed.</li>
        <li><b>Pivot Rule:</b> A player holding the ball with both hands can only move one leg. Moving more than one step is a foul. The player can hold the ball for a maximum of 5 seconds.</li>
        <li><b>Double Dribble:</b> Once a player starts dribbling and then holds the ball with both hands, they cannot dribble again but can pass the ball. Double hand dribbling is also a foul.</li>
